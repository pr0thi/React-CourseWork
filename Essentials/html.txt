- a
- div
- id

boilerplate code -> necessary code

< > = tag
closing and opening tag

alt : optional

div is a rectagular box with w-full h-none
div ki height apni children ke height ke barabar ke hoti hai -> total height of children

id cannot be repeated, it will work but it's not a good practice

=> class can be repeated
