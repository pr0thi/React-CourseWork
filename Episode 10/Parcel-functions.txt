- Code Splitting i.e splitting your files 
- Differential Bundling Parcel takes care of different browsers and different older browsers 
- Diagnostic behind your scenes

- Different Dev and Production bundles 

for dev build use npx index.html
for Production use npx build index.html (before that refer to package.json)

// "main": "App.js", remove this for build while using npx build

dist folder gets created which was compressed using tree shaking 
name of variables are also changed due to compression



We need a lot more things apart from react like bundlers which is making it fast
