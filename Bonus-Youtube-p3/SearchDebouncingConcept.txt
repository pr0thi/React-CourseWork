Higher Order Component recieves a component and returns a component 

Video Card eg 
creation of a Higher Order function returning borders 

//AdVideoCard showing ads 

//Search is the most important thing 

//Develop Search bar 

//Study search first 

//typing depends 
// letter by letter if typing slow 
// 3 api calls for 7 keystrokes 
// z, zx, zxcvbnm

//Flipkart is not making api call on every keypress, unlike 
youtube which if typing slow will call api in every keystroke 

//This concept is called as Debouncing 

//if typing very fast, skipping some of the events 

//if typing very slow, it'll make api call for each keypress

How are we able to achieve this?

Concept - Debouncing:

if you're typing very fast, the difference between two keypress is very less - 30ms say
if slow, difference is high say - 200ms 

if you're typing very fast, do you think users need suggestions? 
//useless to call API for every keystroke 

Performance:
    -iPhone Pro Max 
    14 letters 

    if 1000ppl typing, 14000 api calls 
    with debounding, we maybe just made, 3*1000 = 3000

why are they showing suggestions? for better UX 

in Flipkart debouncing is applied with 200ms
- if difference between 2 keystrokes is less than 200ms -> Not call the API 

if greater than 200ms, make an API call and show the results 

Now compare Flipkart and Youtube, debouncing is very less in YT 
why debouncing is very less, faster apis of google
