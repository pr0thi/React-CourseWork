basics contains = 
    rendering hello world using html js and importing of react library

basics2 contains = 
    rendering hello world through react

And till now everything was done in the html file itself


no from basics 3 we imported the <script> React components </script> in a different JS file

basics3.js contains = 
    meaning of objects and rendering stuff 

app.js contains two parts having a simpler html structure converted to react as well as a complex one
