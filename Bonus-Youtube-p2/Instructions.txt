search api added 

now trying to build debouncing 

input box, head.js 
how to make it work?
tie it/bind it with a state variable 

key - i
    - render the component 
    - calls Use Effect 
    - now here it'll start a time and it'll make an API call after 200ms 

    -iP (P after i)
    - destroy the component(), useEffect method will be called  
    - a gain rerenders the component 
    - again calls useEffect
    - now here timer is same? or different 
    - new timer 

    when we set a setTimeout we need to clear that also 

    
    absolute to make it fix 


making a cache slice 
using map data structure and spread operator 
making reducers and exporting reducer 

adding the slice to store  
const store = configureStore({
    reducer:{
        app:appSlice,
        search:searchSlice,
    },
});

now header component

recursion to create more comments 
comments mai humne map aur array + objects use krke iterate kre hai
